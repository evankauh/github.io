## Introduction
Hello! I'm Evan Kauh, a passionate programmer and explorer of the digital and physical worlds. This page is a brief overview of who I am, both professionally and personally.

### What I Do
I specialize in SDE and have worked on various projects in Java and Python. I love solving problems and building solutions that make a difference.

#### My Programming Philosophy
> "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, itâ€™s bad." - Cory House

Here's a small piece of code that I'm particularly proud of:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
hello_world()
